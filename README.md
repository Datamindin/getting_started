# getting_started
Here we have a data set of Purchase made on Black Friday Sales by people of different occupation, age, city etc.
We will build a regression model based on this dataset which will predict the purchase amount.

But first, We will do some analyses on this dataset
for eg. 
Purchase made by different age groups, ocuupations etc, 
most purchases made by which city people or by which gender.
We will additionally explore hidden patterns through visuals.

After our analysis we do some preprocessing on our dataset before giving it to our ML model (for training) and in return it will predict the purchase amount based on the testing test.
